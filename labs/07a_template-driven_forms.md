## Using Angular Validators

In this exercise you will validate the entries in the search form of the ``FlightSearchComponent`` with the build-in validators ``required``, ``minlength``, ``maxlength`` and ``pattern`` and output any validation errors.

You can use the following procedure as a guide:

1. Make sure that the search fields are in a ``form`` element and set up a handle for this element. Also make sure that each input field has a ``name`` attribute.

    <details>
    <summary>Show source</summary>
    <p>

    ```html
    <form #flightSearchForm="ngForm">
        [...]
        <input name="from" [(ngModel)]="from" [...]>
        [...]
        <input name="to" [(ngModel)]="to" [...]>
        [...]
    </form>
    ```

    </p>
    </details>

2. Extend the search field ``from`` to include the validation attributes mentioned above and report any validation errors.

    <details>
    <summary>Show source</summary>
    <p>

    ```html
    <input name="from" [(ngModel)]="from"   
           required		
           minlength="3"		
           maxlength="15"		
           pattern="[a-zA-ZäöüÄÖÜß ]*">		

    <pre>{{flightSearchForm?.controls.from?.errors | json}}</pre>

    [...]
    <div class="text-danger" 
         *ngIf="flightSearchForm?.controls.from?.hasError('minlength')">		
        ... minlength ...
    </div>		
    [...]
    ```

    </p>
    </details>

3. Test your solution

## Bonus: Reusable component for displaying the validation errors *

In order not to have to query the validation errors in the same way over and over again for each input field, it is advisable to use a central component. This can receive the property ``errors`` of the validated ``FormControl``. For example, the expression ``f?.Controls['from']?.errors`` returns the following object if both the validator ``minlength`` and a possibly self-written``city`` validator fail:

```json
{
  "minlength": {
    "requiredLength": 3,
    "actualLength": 1
  },
  "city": true
}
```

Write a component that receives this ``errors`` object (``@Input() errors: any;``) and outputs an error message for each of the errors in it. To check whether this object exists and whether it indicates a specific error, *ngIf can be used:

```html
<div *ngIf="errors && errors['required']">
    This field is required.
</div>

<div *ngIf="errors && errors['minlength']">
    This field is too short.
</div>
```

This component should be able to be called up as follows:

```html
<div class="form-group">
    <label>From</label>
    <input class="form-control" [(ngModel)]="from" name="from" 
           required minlength="3">
    
    <flight-validation-errors [errors]="flightSearchForm?.controls.from?.errors">
    </flight-validation-errors>
</div>
```
